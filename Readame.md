### Product Vision: Style Arena

**Core Concept**: Style Arena is a social photo-sharing app centered around a daily style competition.
- Users showcase their personal style by posting a photo each day.
- After posting their picture, they're receive pairs for pictures on which they have to vote for a winner.
- At the end of the day, an ELO score is computed and a top 3 Daily style is sent to everyone.
- Users can tag the brands they're wearing and brands can use the platform to promote their products via playful competition.

###  Core Loop: Post - Judge - Discover - Repeat

This is the engine driving daily engagement and habit formation:

1. **Post Your Style (Daily)**:
    - Each day, users are prompted to post one and only one picture of their outfit of the day.
    - Emphasis on quick and easy posting.
    - A final version would also include the option to tag brands (Not included in MVP)
2. **Judge (Daily)**:
    - After posting (or even before), users are presented with pairs of style photos from other users participating in the daily competition.
    - They are asked to simply pick which style they prefer in each pair.
    - The judging process is quick, almost like a mini-game, encouraging repeated evaluations. (MVP: one pair, future iterations: more pairs).
3. **Daily Ranking**:
    - An ELO-based ranking system (or a simpler vote count initially) determines the top styles of the day.
    - Rankings are displayed on a daily leaderboard.
    - Everyone can discover the best trending styles and the brands used by the winners.

### Could this reach 1M DAU ?

A few keys points that could make that app go viral :
- **Daily Style Ritual :** The daily style competition creates a compelling daily ritual. Users are motivated to post every day to participate and compete.
- **Intentional Limitations** : Users can only post one style per day and need to post to be able to judge their peers. "A product is a package of emphasis".
- **Peer Validation & Positive Feedback:** StyleSnap focuses on peer recognition, offering immediate validation through votes and daily rankings. This positive feedback loop is inherently engaging and encourages users to both post and judge regularly.
- **Democratized Style Inspiration :** The voting system allows everyone to get the same amount of votes no matter what their popularity. Each day is a new day and everyone could potentially win.
- **Playful Competition:** The daily competition element adds a layer of fun and gamification. People are naturally competitive and enjoy friendly contests.
